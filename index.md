# About Me

Hi, my name is Ali Bakhtiari. I am originally from Iran. I came to the U.S. in 2009, a couple of weeks before Obama inauguration!

I have been working as a data scientist since 2014. I have a PhD in Management Science from the University of Texas at Dallas. I have worked on a variety of projects in the field of data science, machine learning. I really love deploying ML projects and seeing its impact on the business and customers. Check out my resume to get more familiar with my background and work experiences.

I am tennis fanatic and also a decent player. I am always looking for new people to hit with :)

Also, please check out my data science notes. I decided to publish my data science/ML notes from all the courses and materials I have studied over the years. I hope you find them useful.
